# Wedding Website

This is a wedding website for two computer programmers getting married on April 11, 2026.

## Project Overview

A simple, one-or-two page static HTML + CSS website that will be sent directly to wedding guests. This site is not intended to be crawled by search engines.

## Tech Stack

- **Static HTML + Tailwind CSS v4** - Simple, lightweight, and effective
- **Node.js** - Used for build scripts and local development server

## Design

- **Accent Color**: #664cdc (purple/violet)
- **Dominant Color**: White
- **Secondary Color**: Very pale, lavender-tinted slate gray
- **Style**: Clean, minimal, programmer-friendly

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will build Tailwind CSS and start a local server at http://localhost:3000 with CSS hot-reloading.

To build the CSS once (for production):

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

Since this is a static site, it can be deployed to any static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
